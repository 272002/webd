    </center>
    <p>Its never been easier for food companies to reach their customers. Restaurant delivery has grown 20% in the last
        five years; while estimates differ, online food delivery sales are estimated to grow as high as $220 billion by
        2023 â€“ 40% of total restaurant sales. As for 0nline grocery, Deutsche Bank estimates that the $24 billion online
        grocery market will surge to 120$ billion by 2025.

        This hypergrowth may have been accelerated by the global impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, but what enabled its
        success is the (relatively) recent proliferation of delivery models and fleet types: same hour, same day and
        next day delivery; single fleet, multi-fleet, crowdsourced fleets and in-house fleets; deliver from store,
        curbside pickup, delivery from robotic warehouses, and so many others.

        With all this opportunity comes no small amount of competition, and restaurants, grocers and other food
        providers must stay abreast of where the market is going.</p>
